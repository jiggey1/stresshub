had this for a guy, he got termd and i lost contact, instead of a waste of time, you can have it instead.

It's kinda responsive, kinda not. He was term'd before, the only thing I know is fucked up is the old Discord template (once again, didnt get to fix)





not updating anymore, this is the ONLY thing i'm doing with this project.
